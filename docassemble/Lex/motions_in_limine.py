McGee" + self.ITALIC + ", 219 Or App 78, (2008). " + color.NLINE + "Some defense attorneys have recently tried to make an end-run around the inadmissibility of such evidence by attempting to introduce evidence that medical charges, as a whole, are unreasonable simply because some medical providers sometimes accept some unspecified discounted payment secondary to insurance contracts. Any such evidence is inadmissible and improper for two primary reasons: " + color.NLINE + "First, it is an attempt at an end run around the collateral source rule and " + self.ITALIC + "White v. Jubitz Corp." + self.ITALIC + " under the guise of challenging the reasonableness of medical bills in general. While a defendant has the right to challenge the amount charged for medical services as not reasonable and/or necessary, they don’t get to rely on the presence of collateral source benefits to do so. Any testimony to this effect necessarily relies on collateral source payments to determine the reasonableness of bills. This type of evidence is contrary to Oregon’s strict prohibition against it. " + color.NLINE + "Second, any such argument is circular and nonsensical. If the theory is that the amount charged for a medical bill is unreasonable simply because the provider would accept a percentage of that amount as payment from an insurer, then any amount charged would be per se unreasonable as a matter of law. Insurers pay a percentage of any amount charged, pursuant to their contract with the provider. A percentage of any positive integer will always be the lesser. Thus, insurers always pay at a discount, even with the most reasonable of charges. " + color.NLINE + "For example, if the theory is that a $100 medical bill is unreasonable because the provider accepts 60% of that charge for payment from a particular health insurer, then $60 would also be unreasonable in the event the provider reduced the amount charged to that figure, as the insurer would still only pay 60% of that bill. Additionally, different insurers pay at different rates, with Medicare often being the lowest. Who is to say at what percentage a bill becomes “reasonable?”  Indeed, how could they? It would be wholly provider dependent and would necessarily require each and every provider to come to trial to testify as to what their average insurance payments are, from whom, over what time, for what services, and so on. " + color.NLINE + "Moreover, folks without health insurance are billed the very same rate, and are expected to pay the full amount charged, and get turned over to collections if they don’t do so. If the court is to look at “reasonableness” as to what each provider expects to get paid for their services, are uninsured folks excluded from that conversation? Surely not. Thus, under any such theory of “reasonableness,” the jury would necessarily need to know what insurer covers the plaintiff, how much they paid for each service, what their deductible was for each bill, what their co-pay was for each bill, and how much was written off.  In other words, it would require evidence that is specifically excluded under Oregon’s collateral source rule discussed above. " + color.NLINE + "Finally, insurers can negotiate these discounted rates thanks to a few special characteristics that no individual would have. For example, insurers have unparalleled bargaining power in that their insureds will actively avoid out of network providers. Further, insurers employ expert negotiators to get these special rates. A plaintiff in a personal injury lawsuit can’t honestly be held to the standard of an expert negotiator. " + color.NLINE + "This line of examination or evidence of the same is wholly speculative, meritless, and should be denied.  self.user_clientlist().asnoun() is not aware of any appellate authority in Oregon addressing this issue (likely because this novel argument often advanced by the defense bar is such a new formulation), although appellate courts in other jurisdictions, as well as numerous Oregon trial courts, have rejected similar evidence.
