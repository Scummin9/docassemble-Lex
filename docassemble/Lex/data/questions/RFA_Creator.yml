    Relevant ORCPs
  content: |
    **ORCP 45A Request for admission:** After commencement of an action, a party may serve on any other party a request for the admission by the latter of the truth of relevant matters within the scope of Rule 36 B specified in the request, including facts or opinions of fact, or the application of law to fact, or of the genuineness of any relevant documents or physical objects described in or exhibited with the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. Each matter of which an admission is requested shall be separately set forth. The request may, without leave of court, be served on the plaintiff after commencement of the action and on any other party with or after service of the summons and complaint on that party. . . . 
    **ORCP 45D Effect of Admission:** Any matter admitted pursuant to this rule is conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. . . .
    **ORCP 45F(1) [Number] Generally:** Excluding requests identified in subsection F(2) of this rule, a party may serve more than one set of requested admissions on an adverse party but the total number of requests shall not exceed 30, unless the court otherwise orders for good cause shown after the proposed additional requests have been filed. In determining what constitutes a request for admission for the purpose of applying this limitation in number, it is intended that each request be counted separately, whether or not it is subsidiary or incidental to or dependent upon or included in another request, and however the requests may be grouped, combined, or arranged.
    **ORCP 45F(2)[Number]  Requests Related to Admissibility of Business Records:** Notwithstanding subsection F(1) of this rule, and in addition to any requests made under that subsection, a party may serve a reasonable number of additional requests for admission to establish the authenticity and admissibility of documents under ORS 40.460 (6) (Rule 803(6) of the Oregon Evidence Code).
     **ORCP 36 B(1) [Scope of Discovery] In General:** For all forms of discovery, parties may inquire   regarding any matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things, and the identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is not a ground for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    **ORCP 46 C Expenses on Failure to Admit:** If a party fails to admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter, as requested under Rule 45, and if the party requesting the admission thereafter proves the genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, the party requesting the admission may apply to the court for an order requiring the other party to pay the party requesting the admission the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, including reasonable attorney fees. 
    The court shall make the order unless it finds that: 
    * the request was held objectionable pursuant to Rule 45 B or C; 
    * the admission sought was of no substantial importance; 
    * the party failing to admit had reasonable grounds to believe that it might prevail on the matter; or 
    * there was other good reason for the failure to admit.
