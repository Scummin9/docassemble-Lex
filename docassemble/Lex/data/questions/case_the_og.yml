      *But see La Chemise Lacoste v. Alligator Co.*, 60 FRD 164, 171 (D Del 1973). Generally, if a party has information, it should disclose it regardless of its source and availability. *See, e.g.*, *Reichert v. United States*, 51 FRD 500, 503 (ND Cal 1970). However, if the responding party does not have custody or control of the information or related documents, or if the answers to the interrogatories are in public documents, the court may hold that the responding party need not provide the answers. *La Chemise Lacoste*, 60 FRD at 171. Generally, “interrogatories that require a party to make extensive investigations, research or compilation or evaluation of data for his adversary are in many circumstances improper.” 8A Federal Practice and Procedure §2174 at 550.

      When considering whether an interrogatory is overly broad or unduly burdensome, courts will weigh it against "the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit." FRCP 26(b)(1); *see also* FRCP 33(a)(2) ("An interrogatory may relate to any matter that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b)"). *See generally EEOC v. Bumble Bee Seafoods Co.*, 1979 US Dist Lexis 13799, at *9 (D Or Mar 14, 1979) (court held that discovery of 13-year-old documents would be “unduly burdensome in light of the marginal relevance and the cost of compiling” them); *Evans v. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers*, 313 F Supp 1354, 1360 (ND Ga 1969) (“to require a corporate opponent to both answer the interrogatory and identify the source of its answer and any other source of information relating to the subject of the interrogatory, is, in the context of Title VII civil actions, unduly burdensome”).

      Objecting to an interrogatory because it asks for information already available to the propounding party is questionable, but the court may limit discovery on this ground (presumably on a motion for a protective order) if the problem is substantial under Rule 26(b)(1).

question: |
  Your objections have been recorded. Please type out Plaintiff's answer, given under oath, below.
right: |
  “Each interrogatory must, to the extent it is not objected to, be answered separately and fully in writing under oath.” FRCP 33(b)(3). The objecting party must state “with specificity” the reasons for any objection. FRCP 33(b)(4); LR 33.2(b). If an objection is made to part of an interrogatory, “the remainder of the interrogatory must be answered at the time the objection is made, or within the period of any extension of the time to answer, whichever is later.” LR 33.2(b). 
        
    The answers to interrogatories must be “responsive, full, complete and unevasive.” *Miller v. Doctor’s General Hospital*, 76 FRD 136, 140 (WD Okla 1977); *Pilling v. General Motors Corp.*, 45 FRD 366, 369 (D Utah 1968). A party who “lacks necessary information to make a full, fair and specific answer to an interrogatory . . . should so state under oath and should set forth in detail the efforts made to obtain the information.” *Miller*, 76 FRD at 140 (defendant’s “conclusory statement” that an interrogatory sought medical information that defendant was not qualified to give was “not a sufficient response”). 
        
    In responding to an interrogatory, a party cannot unreasonably limit his or her answer to matters within the party’s own knowledge and ignore information immediately available to the party or under the party’s control. *Pilling*, 45 FRD at 369 (the court held that the plaintiff could not refuse to answer interrogatories “merely on the ground that the information sought is solely within the knowledge of his attorney”); *accord Miller*, 76 FRD at 140. 
        
    A party can explain the hearsay nature of information the party provides in its answer by stating, for example, “I do not personally have any firsthand information concerning this question, however, I have been informed by . . . .” *See Riley v. United Air Lines, Inc.*, 32 FRD 230, 233 (SDNY 1962).
