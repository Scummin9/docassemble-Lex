Seismic Bowling Promotions, LLC, et al.\n\nKlamath County Circuit Court Case No. 18CV55855\n\nMediation Date: November 22, 2019, 10:00 a.m.\n\nTrial Date: January 21-24, 2020\nDear Judge Rasmussen:\nWe are grateful that you have been chosen to mediate the above related matter. To that end, please\nallow this letter to serve as the Estate of Terry Paulette Kirwan\u2019s Mediation Memorandum.\n\nINTRODUCTION OF THE PARTIES AND ATTORNEYS\nI represent John Kirwan, in his capacity as personal representative of his mother, Terry Paulette\nKirwan\u2019s estate, relative to a motor vehicle collision that occurred north of Klamath Falls, Oregon\ntwo years ago. He brings this action on behalf of the Estate of Kirwan\u2019s statutory beneficiaries \u2014\nMs. Kirwan\u2019s sons (himself, William and Adam) and her daughters (Maryanne and Elizabeth).\nThe adverse driver, Austin C. Haynes (hereinafter referred to as \u201cHaynes\u2019\u2019), admits to driving while\nintoxicated at the time, and is represented by Tracy McGovern. My understanding is that, because\nHaynes\u2019 insurer has offered its policy limits to resolve the claim against him, Ms. McGovern may\nnot be participating in the mediation itself.\nA dramshop action has been filed against both bars Haynes was drinking at on the afternoon in\nquestion. To that end, Matt Ukishima represents the first bar he as at, Seismic Bowling\nPromotions, LLC, which does business as the Aftershock Restaurant and Nightclub, among other\nsimilar names (hereinafter referred to as \u201cAftershock\u2019\u2019). My understanding is that Mr. Ukishima\nhas asked his carrier for permission to participate in the mediation, though may be given little, if\nany, settlement authority for reasons that will make themselves more clear below.\nChris Parker and William Davis represent the second bar he was at that afternoon, Melita\u2019s Crater\nLake Adventures, LLC (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMelita\u2019s\u2019).\nFor your reference, the operative Amended Complaint in this action is attached as Exhibit 1.\nHaynes\u2019 Answer to Amended Complaint is attached as Exhibit 2. Aftershock\u2019s Answer and\nAffirmative Defenses has been attached as Exhibit 3. Melita\u2019s Answer and Affirmative Defenses\nis attached as Exhibit 4.\nToll Free: 1-800-285-8678\nOffices Located in: Bend, Eugene, Grants Pass, Medford, Portland and Roseburg\n\f"

DEFENDANT\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nThis matter is before the Court upon objections to the Magistrate\u2019s Order (DN 20) granting\nPlaintiff Lyman Powell\u2019s (\u201cPowell\u201d) Motion for Leave to Take Discovery. In its objections,\nHartford argues that the Magistrate\u2019s Order was contrary to clearly established Sixth Circuit\nauthority which holds that discovery is not appropriate in an ERISA action absent a threshold\nshowing by a plaintiff of a procedural challenge to a plan administrator\u2019s decision. For the\nfollowing reasons, Hartford\u2019s objections are overruled.\n\nFACTS\n\nFollowing a decision by the Defendant to terminate his long-term disability benefits, Plaintiff\nPowell filed an administrative appeal. In conjunction with his appeal, the Defendant referred his file\nto University Disability Consortium (\u201cUDC\u201d), an independent contractor that conducts medical\nreviews for disability claims. The physician who reviewed Mr. Powell\u2019s file for UDC concluded\nthat Mr. Powell\u2019s medical records contained no objective evidence indicating that he could not\nperform sedentary work. (AR 63). Based in part upon the medical opinion provided by UDC, the\nDefendant upheld its decision to terminate Mr. Powell\u2019s long-term benefits. Mr. Powell then\ninstituted this ERISA action seeking judicial review of Defendant\u2019s decision to terminate his long-\nterm disability benefits and filed a subsequent Motion for Leave to Take Discovery.

INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff was injured during a sudden stop in an elevator at her workplace. The\nbuilding was owned by Landmark and the elevator was maintained by Schindler. This suit\nresulted. Despite Schindler\u2019s claims, Plaintiff has sufficient proof of Schindler\u2019s negligence.\nThis is so under ordinary negligence principles, and more so, applying the doctrine of res\nipsa loquitur. Regardless of Landmark\u2019s maintenance contract with Schindler, moreover,\nLandmark owed a non-delegable duty to protect its invitees from hidden dangers such as the\nmalfunctioning elevator in this case.\n\nThis is not a case for summary judgment. It is for the jury to decide whether Ms.\nEmory was injured due to faulty maintenance. The law has not changed since this Court\nruled. Summary judgment was properly denied then and should be denied now. The words of\nJudge Alley, responding once to a similar situation, are appropriate: \u201cdefendant has raised\nabsolutely nothing new\u2014no new law and no new fact\u2014and [his] time would be better spent\n\f"

Statement of Facts:\n\nOn July 11, 2011, Plaintiff Eric Bauman was invited to the premises of\nDefendants William and Elizabeth Bowen to repair their septic tank. After completing\nhis work, Mr. Bauman went to the front door to notify the Defendants. Without\nwarning, as the Defendant opened the door, a black dog charged at Eric Bauman from\ninside the home, attacked, and bit him at least two times, causing serious and\npermanent injuries. As a result of the Defendant\u2019s negligence and/or strict liability for\ntheir dog\u2019s attack, Mr. Bauman lost a testicle and he has permanent physical and\nemotional injuries.\n\nUnfortunately, this same dog attacked and bit another invitee about one month\nbefore this event, and at no time did the Defendants warn Plaintiff Eric Bauman of the\ndog\u2019s prior history or take any actions to protect the Plaintiff from a further attack.\n\nB.

OF STAMFORD/NORWALK\nVS. : AT STAMFORD\nKEVIN ASHLEY, ET AL : MARCH 18, 2010\nREPLY TO OBJECTION TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\n\nThis case was previously continued from an October trial date due to the fact that Plaintiff\nMelinda Rafii was pregnant with twins in a high risk pregnancy while residing in Italy. Tragically,\nMs. Rafii went into severely premature labor. One of the twins died and the other, Alise\u2019e\nRossetti was born with extreme complications, was just released from intensive care a few weeks\nago and still has significant medical needs. A copy of a recent medical report from her doctor in\nItaly, translated into English, is attached hereto. It would constitute an extreme hardship to require\nMs. Rafii to come to Connecticut at this time. The Plaintiff has also filed a motion for continuance\nof the trial date as a result of these extreme circumstances. Pursuant to standing order, this\nmotion should be referred to the Civil Presiding Judge for a hearing as we are within 6 months\nof trial.\n\nTo force Ms. Rafii to come to Connecticut is improper under these tragic circumstances.\n\u201cAmerican courts, in supervising pretrial proceedings, should exercise special vigilance to protect\nforeign litigants from the danger that unnecessary, or unduly burdensome, discovery may place\nthem in a disadvantageous position. Judicial supervision of discovery should always seek to\nminimize its costs and inconvenience and to prevent improper uses of discovery requests.\u201d\nPietraroia v.

Ford Is \"At Home\" in Oklahoma for General Jurisdiction Purposes\nFord's cardinal thesis on general personal jurisdiction (Brief at 2) is: \"Ford's affiliations\nwith Oklahoma are not so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the\nstate.\"' Ford's substantive argument (Brief at 5-10) stands on only two appellate cases:\nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown (564 U.S. 915 \u2014 2011) and Daimler AG v.\nBauman (134 S.Ct. 746 \u2014 2014).? Though each echoes the catchphrase \"essentially at home in\nthe forum state\" (Goodyear at 919, Daimler at 749), neither offers a comprehensive explanation\nof just what that criterion entails; to the contrary, they go only so far as to provide us two isolated\n' Quotation merged, citation omitted.\n* Though Ford's argument is strewn with district court references from foreign jurisdictions (and, granted, in the next\nsection, this Response will cite to yet others), these hold no more than illustrative value, and are in no way binding\nupon this Court (Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut \u2014 131 8, Ct. 2527, 2540 \u2014 2011: \"Moreover, federal district\njudges, sitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to render precedential decisions binding other judges, even\nmembers of the same court.\").\n\f"

What does it mean? Translated from French, it literally means \u201cto see, to speak.\u201d\nTraditionally, it is the questioning of prospective jurors in court by attorneys and judges. Voir\ndire is one of the most critical aspects of any trial. Many successful attorneys feel that you win\ncases during jury selection. I\u2019m not so sure. However, it is a hugely significant part of the trial\nprocess. Barring any surprises, the combination of a fantastic voir dire and opening statement\nwill move your case into winning territory. Voir dire is a questioning process, called voir dire\nfrom the French term which means \u201cto tell the truth.\u201d It is an elaborate process that involves\njudges and attorneys.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of voir dire? The oft-stated purpose of voir dire questioning is to obtain a\n\u201cfair and impartial jury.\u201d Fair and impartial is so vague that it lacks meaning. \u201cThe ideal of\nimpartiality is precisely that: an ideal. Everyone is biased, and everyone expresses those biases\nin a wide variety of ways.\u201d ERIC OLIVER, PERSUASIVE COMMUNICATION (Trial Guides, Ist ed.\n2009). One of the main goals of a successful voir dire is to tap into the biases that relate to your\ncase. The other main task is to engage with the jurors in a way that is meaningful and helps to\nbuild a relationship where a bond is formed.\n\nVoir dire is also the first time where you get to connect with the prospective jury members. It is\nan intuitive process of creating a relationship with the jury, made more fluid by revealing your\nown experiences, prejudices, and fears. If you are willing to risk something meaningful, the jury\nmay feel safe to share at the same level. This revelation is something discovered long before\nvoir dire, and relates to the danger points of your case or the fears you have uncovered about\nyour case. Authentically engaging with the jurors will facilitate the creation of an empowered\njury that will be more willing to fight for your client. To do so, however, requires some courage\non your part\u2014in order to be effective at voir dire, you must be willing to share yourself.\n\nI. Getting Jurors to Talk\n\nReveal Something About Yourself\n\nGerry Spence said, \u201cIt all begins with you.\u201d By sharing something meaningful, we give the jury\npermission to be honest with us and to share their prejudices and life experiences. Approach a\njuror in a similar way as you would when talking to someone you just met who you are\ngenuinely interested in getting to know better. What applies to the element of a good\n\f"

When I contacted the attorneys I learned that the case had settled\n22\nfor a confidential amount. I also learned that upon settlement all depositions of Aetna\n23\npersonnel were sealed and could not be disseminated. The one exception to this I\n24\nlearned was the deposition of Judy Talley because that deposition had been\n29\ndisseminated prior to the settlement being reached. I asked for and obtained a copy of\n26\nTalley's deposition.

Stated simply, the dispute between plaintiff and Country revolves around medical bills\nthat were submitted to Country for payment, but Country did not pay. In that context, some of\nthe requests are so vague, overbroad, and indiscernible that we cannot figure out exactly what\nplaintiff is asking for. Some simply seem irrelevant. Moreover, much of what plaintiff requests\nhas already been provided.\n\nAs one example, plaintiff asks for documents \u201csent to Plaintiff or Plaintiff\u2019s agents from\nDefendant or Defendant\u2019s agents regarding the collision, Plaintiff\u2019s injuries, or Plaintiff\u2019s claim\nfor damages.\u201d It is self-evident that plaintiff or her agents (her attorneys) already have these\nrecords. Perhaps we are missing the point of some requests but requiring Country to do again\nwhat it has already done and to produce records that are not relevant and will not lead to the\ndiscovery of relevant evidence seems to be a waste of everyone\u2019s time and energy.\n\n900 SW FITtnh Avenue | 24th Floor | Portland, OR 97204 | p:803-2323-9000 1:503-223-9019 | www. coagravelaw.com\n\f"

To that end, please\nallow this letter to serve as the Estate of Terry Paulette Kirwan\u2019s Mediation Memorandum.\n\nINTRODUCTION OF THE PARTIES AND ATTORNEYS\nI represent John Kirwan, in his capacity as personal representative of his mother, Terry Paulette\nKirwan\u2019s estate, relative to a motor vehicle collision that occurred north of Klamath Falls, Oregon\ntwo years ago. He brings this action on behalf of the Estate of Kirwan\u2019s statutory beneficiaries \u2014\nMs. Kirwan\u2019s sons (himself, William and Adam) and her daughters (Maryanne and Elizabeth).\nThe adverse driver, Austin C. Haynes (hereinafter referred to as \u201cHaynes\u2019\u2019), admits to driving while\nintoxicated at the time, and is represented by Tracy McGovern. My understanding is that, because\nHaynes\u2019 insurer has offered its policy limits to resolve the claim against him, Ms. McGovern may\nnot be participating in the mediation itself.\nA dramshop action has been filed against both bars Haynes was drinking at on the afternoon in\nquestion. To that end, Matt Ukishima represents the first bar he as at, Seismic Bowling\nPromotions, LLC, which does business as the Aftershock Restaurant and Nightclub, among other\nsimilar names (hereinafter referred to as \u201cAftershock\u2019\u2019). My understanding is that Mr. Ukishima\nhas asked his carrier for permission to participate in the mediation, though may be given little, if\nany, settlement authority for reasons that will make themselves more clear below.\nChris Parker and William Davis represent the second bar he was at that afternoon, Melita\u2019s Crater\nLake Adventures, LLC (hereinafter referred to as \u201cMelita\u2019s\u2019).\nFor your reference, the operative Amended Complaint in this action is attached as Exhibit 1.\nHaynes\u2019 Answer to Amended Complaint is attached as Exhibit 2. Aftershock\u2019s Answer and\nAffirmative Defenses has been attached as Exhibit 3. Melita\u2019s Answer and Affirmative Defenses\nis attached as Exhibit 4.\nToll Free: 1-800-285-8678\nOffices Located in: Bend, Eugene, Grants Pass, Medford, Portland and Roseburg\n\f"

INTRODUCTION\n\nPlaintiff was injured during a sudden stop in an elevator at her workplace. The\nbuilding was owned by Landmark and the elevator was maintained by Schindler. This suit\nresulted. Despite Schindler\u2019s claims, Plaintiff has sufficient proof of Schindler\u2019s negligence.\nThis is so under ordinary negligence principles, and more so, applying the doctrine of res\nipsa loquitur. Regardless of Landmark\u2019s maintenance contract with Schindler, moreover,\nLandmark owed a non-delegable duty to protect its invitees from hidden dangers such as the\nmalfunctioning elevator in this case.\n\nThis is not a case for summary judgment. It is for the jury to decide whether Ms.\nEmory was injured due to faulty maintenance. The law has not changed since this Court\nruled. Summary judgment was properly denied then and should be denied now. The words of\nJudge Alley, responding once to a similar situation, are appropriate: \u201cdefendant has raised\nabsolutely nothing new\u2014no new law and no new fact\u2014and [his] time would be better spent\n\f"

DEFENDANT\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\n\nThis matter is before the Court upon objections to the Magistrate\u2019s Order (DN 20) granting\nPlaintiff Lyman Powell\u2019s (\u201cPowell\u201d) Motion for Leave to Take Discovery. In its objections,\nHartford argues that the Magistrate\u2019s Order was contrary to clearly established Sixth Circuit\nauthority which holds that discovery is not appropriate in an ERISA action absent a threshold\nshowing by a plaintiff of a procedural challenge to a plan administrator\u2019s decision. For the\nfollowing reasons, Hartford\u2019s objections are overruled.\n\nFACTS\n\nFollowing a decision by the Defendant to terminate his long-term disability benefits, Plaintiff\nPowell filed an administrative appeal. In conjunction with his appeal, the Defendant referred his file\nto University Disability Consortium (\u201cUDC\u201d), an independent contractor that conducts medical\nreviews for disability claims. The physician who reviewed Mr. Powell\u2019s file for UDC concluded\nthat Mr. Powell\u2019s medical records contained no objective evidence indicating that he could not\nperform sedentary work. (AR 63). Based in part upon the medical opinion provided by UDC, the\nDefendant upheld its decision to terminate Mr. Powell\u2019s long-term benefits. Mr. Powell then\ninstituted this ERISA action seeking judicial review of Defendant\u2019s decision to terminate his long-\nterm disability benefits and filed a subsequent Motion for Leave to Take Discovery.

OF STAMFORD/NORWALK\nVS. : AT STAMFORD\nKEVIN ASHLEY, ET AL : MARCH 18, 2010\nREPLY TO OBJECTION TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER\n\nThis case was previously continued from an October trial date due to the fact that Plaintiff\nMelinda Rafii was pregnant with twins in a high risk pregnancy while residing in Italy. Tragically,\nMs. Rafii went into severely premature labor. One of the twins died and the other, Alise\u2019e\nRossetti was born with extreme complications, was just released from intensive care a few weeks\nago and still has significant medical needs. A copy of a recent medical report from her doctor in\nItaly, translated into English, is attached hereto. It would constitute an extreme hardship to require\nMs. Rafii to come to Connecticut at this time. The Plaintiff has also filed a motion for continuance\nof the trial date as a result of these extreme circumstances. Pursuant to standing order, this\nmotion should be referred to the Civil Presiding Judge for a hearing as we are within 6 months\nof trial.\n\nTo force Ms. Rafii to come to Connecticut is improper under these tragic circumstances.\n\u201cAmerican courts, in supervising pretrial proceedings, should exercise special vigilance to protect\nforeign litigants from the danger that unnecessary, or unduly burdensome, discovery may place\nthem in a disadvantageous position. Judicial supervision of discovery should always seek to\nminimize its costs and inconvenience and to prevent improper uses of discovery requests.\u201d\nPietraroia v.

Ford Is \"At Home\" in Oklahoma for General Jurisdiction Purposes\nFord's cardinal thesis on general personal jurisdiction (Brief at 2) is: \"Ford's affiliations\nwith Oklahoma are not so continuous and systematic as to render it essentially at home in the\nstate.\"' Ford's substantive argument (Brief at 5-10) stands on only two appellate cases:\nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown (564 U.S. 915 \u2014 2011) and Daimler AG v.\nBauman (134 S.Ct. 746 \u2014 2014).? Though each echoes the catchphrase \"essentially at home in\nthe forum state\" (Goodyear at 919, Daimler at 749), neither offers a comprehensive explanation\nof just what that criterion entails; to the contrary, they go only so far as to provide us two isolated\n' Quotation merged, citation omitted.\n* Though Ford's argument is strewn with district court references from foreign jurisdictions (and, granted, in the next\nsection, this Response will cite to yet others), these hold no more than illustrative value, and are in no way binding\nupon this Court (Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connecticut \u2014 131 8, Ct. 2527, 2540 \u2014 2011: \"Moreover, federal district\njudges, sitting as sole adjudicators, lack authority to render precedential decisions binding other judges, even\nmembers of the same court.\").\n\f"

Stated simply, the dispute between plaintiff and Country revolves around medical bills\nthat were submitted to Country for payment, but Country did not pay. In that context, some of\nthe requests are so vague, overbroad, and indiscernible that we cannot figure out exactly what\nplaintiff is asking for. Some simply seem irrelevant. Moreover, much of what plaintiff requests\nhas already been provided.\n\nAs one example, plaintiff asks for documents \u201csent to Plaintiff or Plaintiff\u2019s agents from\nDefendant or Defendant\u2019s agents regarding the collision, Plaintiff\u2019s injuries, or Plaintiff\u2019s claim\nfor damages.\u201d It is self-evident that plaintiff or her agents (her attorneys) already have these\nrecords. Perhaps we are missing the point of some requests but requiring Country to do again\nwhat it has already done and to produce records that are not relevant and will not lead to the\ndiscovery of relevant evidence seems to be a waste of everyone\u2019s time and energy.\n\n900 SW FITtnh Avenue | 24th Floor | Portland, OR 97204 | p:803-2323-9000 1:503-223-9019 | www. coagravelaw.com\n\f"

What does it mean? Translated from French, it literally means \u201cto see, to speak.\u201d\nTraditionally, it is the questioning of prospective jurors in court by attorneys and judges. Voir\ndire is one of the most critical aspects of any trial. Many successful attorneys feel that you win\ncases during jury selection. I\u2019m not so sure. However, it is a hugely significant part of the trial\nprocess. Barring any surprises, the combination of a fantastic voir dire and opening statement\nwill move your case into winning territory. Voir dire is a questioning process, called voir dire\nfrom the French term which means \u201cto tell the truth.\u201d It is an elaborate process that involves\njudges and attorneys.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of voir dire? The oft-stated purpose of voir dire questioning is to obtain a\n\u201cfair and impartial jury.\u201d Fair and impartial is so vague that it lacks meaning. \u201cThe ideal of\nimpartiality is precisely that: an ideal. Everyone is biased, and everyone expresses those biases\nin a wide variety of ways.\u201d ERIC OLIVER, PERSUASIVE COMMUNICATION (Trial Guides, Ist ed.\n2009). One of the main goals of a successful voir dire is to tap into the biases that relate to your\ncase. The other main task is to engage with the jurors in a way that is meaningful and helps to\nbuild a relationship where a bond is formed.\n\nVoir dire is also the first time where you get to connect with the prospective jury members. It is\nan intuitive process of creating a relationship with the jury, made more fluid by revealing your\nown experiences, prejudices, and fears. If you are willing to risk something meaningful, the jury\nmay feel safe to share at the same level. This revelation is something discovered long before\nvoir dire, and relates to the danger points of your case or the fears you have uncovered about\nyour case. Authentically engaging with the jurors will facilitate the creation of an empowered\njury that will be more willing to fight for your client. To do so, however, requires some courage\non your part\u2014in order to be effective at voir dire, you must be willing to share yourself.\n\nI. Getting Jurors to Talk\n\nReveal Something About Yourself\n\nGerry Spence said, \u201cIt all begins with you.\u201d By sharing something meaningful, we give the jury\npermission to be honest with us and to share their prejudices and life experiences. Approach a\njuror in a similar way as you would when talking to someone you just met who you are\ngenuinely interested in getting to know better. What applies to the element of a good\n\f"
